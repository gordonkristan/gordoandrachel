      <h2>About the Event</h2>
      <p>
        Join us at Avenue Tap and help us raise money to buy home goods for Nourishing Hope!

        Many of you know that we've been volunteering for Nourishing Hope for the last 9 months and we absolutely love it. We love the work, the staff, the other volunteers, and the clients. Rachel loves it so much she recently took a job with them coordinating home food deliveries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our volunteer home is, and always will be, the Nourishing Hope location at El Mercadito, located in West Humboldt Park. We really enjoy our time there and we want to give back to the community as much as we can. One area that our location is always in need of – because Nourishing Hope doesn't have dedicated funds for them – are household goods. We never have enough to go around, even for basic necessities like laundry soap or shampoo. So in order to fill that gap Rachel called around and got a killer deal on bulk shampoo and conditioner – only $2.29 a bottle! So our goal is to raise as much money as we can and buy as much as we can so that all of the families in that community can have access to the basic necessities that we all take for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        So please join us for what is sure to be a fun evening!
      </p>
